Hello! My name is Shane, and I've been fascinated with human performance for as long as I can remember. One of the greatest tragedies in my opinion is a motivated person who tries incredibly hard but is unable to succeed because they lack the best resources. This project is the first phase in my quest to **provide motivated people with the best tools in the world to succeed and be happy**.

I strongly believe that:
- Everything can be trained
- Life balance and excellence _is_ possible if you're efficient
- Nothing is impossible until proven so

I hope these tools help you achieve your goals, bringing happiness to yourself and the people around you. If these aren't the best tools in the world, then let me know and contribute to make this even better.

I wish you best of luck on your endeavors and happiness on your journey!

<br/>

Your friend,

Shane Mileham
