## How to contribute

_You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)._

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Follow the in-browser editing instructions listed [here](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

Remember to:
- Give the pull request and commit a useful title (not `Update README.md`).
- Add resources to the bottom of the relevant category (unless they should obviously be utilized before another resource, in which case place it before).
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your contributions!
