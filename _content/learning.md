## Introduction to Learning
### Definitions
- Learning = the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing existing, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences which may lead to a potential change in synthesizing information, depth of the knowledge, attitude or behavior relative to the type and range of experience. (Wikipedia)
- Knowledge = facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject (Google)


Beliefs <--> Experiences

**Model**
- BELIEFS → EXPERIENCES ----- Action/Thoughts - Instrumental Rationality
- EXPERIENCES → BELIEFS ----- Induction/Deduction - Epistemic Rationality

Experiences include hypotheticals
(Cyclical - whole thing can be be referred to as self-programming)

- **Design**: to create, fashion, execute, or construct according to plan; to devise for a specific function or end (Merriam-Webster)
- **Experience**: the act or process of directly perceiving events or reality (Merriam-Webster)
- **Induction (bottom-up)**: the process of inferring a general law from particular instances (Google)
- **Belief**: Belief is the mental state in which an individual holds a proposition to be true. Beliefs are often metaphorically referred to as maps, and are considered valid to the extent that they correctly correspond to the truth. A person's knowledge is a subset of their beliefs, namely the beliefs that are also true and justified. Beliefs can be second-order, concerning propositions about other beliefs. Any belief should restrict which experiences to anticipate, to be potentially useful and thereby pay rent and earn its keep in your mind, so to speak. If a belief does not affect what you anticipate experiencing—if the world would look exactly the same whether the belief is true or whether it is false—then how could you possibly tell if it were false? And if there's no circumstance under which you would be able to notice your belief were false, then why do you believe it now? (LessWrong)
- **Deduction (top-down)**: the process of inferring particular instances from a general law (Google). The process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion…. Deductive reasoning links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.
- **Action**: the fact or process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim (Google)


Scientific method - https://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb:
- Experience → Abductive reasoning → Hypothesis → Experience
- Experience → Inductive reasoning → Hypothesis → Experience
- Experience → Deductive reasoning → Belief

Steps to Learn Anything:
- Design (Create experiences) - Obtain useful pieces of information through experiences
- Decide what specifically you want to learn
- Identify keywords related to the chosen topic
- Induction (Create beliefs) - Process information and find the patterns to create beliefs
- Deduction (Act on beliefs) - Iterate on your model by testing beliefs in hypothetical scenarios

List techniques for each step (implementation details)
- Pomodoro
- Sleep
- Repetition / SR
- Teach another person
- Etc.

How to use this model:
1. Subject = Define the subject (contextual)
  - What is X? In what direction do I want to learn?
  - What is my goal?
2. Model = Create a model of the subject
  - What is X composed of? (Mutually exclusive and exhaustive)
  - How do I break down the goal?
3. Definition = Define the parts of the model
  - What are those parts?
  - What are the subgoals?
4. Question = Write the questions to the model
  - What questions do I need to be able to answer to understand X?
  - What do I need to do to accomplish the subgoal?
  - If you had 10min with an expert in X, what would you ask?
  - Who, What, When, Where, Why, Which, How → More info
  - Is, Does → Boolean
5. Answer = Practice answering the questions
  - What are the answers to those questions?
  - What are the answers to “What do I need to do to accomplish the subgoal?”?
6. Practice = Practice behaviors needed to be successful at the subject
  - How do I practice X?
  - How do I do the things necessary to accomplish the subgoal?

Talk to the person you know who is likely to know X best. Ask them who they know who knows X. Ask that person. Repeat through network connections until you are in contact with experts on X. Then ask them the questions listed in the “Steps to learn anything"

* Experience/Pattern --> causal expectation
* Order should be: dissect things correctly, chunk in incremental complexity until intuitive (basal ganglia)
* Endgame first (chess) - each step out adds one level of inference/complexity
* Expectation-Experience back and forth
  * Expectation to experience is created by your choices (which is created by your questions)
  * Experience to expectation/beliefs is modified by your cognitive biases. Here's (link) how to rationally form a model of the world.
- State affects accessing of beliefs - not covered in this
- Decisions also include evaluating alternatives for action in each case (https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_human-relations/s12-01-understanding-decision-making.html)
- Knowing, Habitualize, Intuitive (emotional)
- We can define learning as simply any change to the connections in our neuronal networks.
- An experience either meshes with existing information (intuitive) or doesn’t fit (counterintuitive). What to do in each state.
- Experience can include blueprints (someone else’s learning from their data)
- Practice, isolated drills,
- Superimpose your structure onto the optimal structure
