## Introduction to Learning
learning = acquiring improved stimulus responses to be able to attain one's goals

From the dictionary:
```
Knowledge = facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject
```
```
Learning = the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or by being taught.
```

## To add
* Experience/Pattern --> causal expectation
* Order should be: dissect things correctly, chunk in incremental complexity until intuitive (basal ganglia)
* Endgame first (chess) - each step out adds one level of inference/complexity
* Expectation-Experience back and forth
  * Expectation to experience is created by your choices (which is created by your questions)
  * Experience to expectation/beliefs is modified by your cognitive biases. Here's (link) how to rationally form a model of the world.
