## Steps

### Identify Tasks to Outsource
All tasks to be outsourced are things where your time would be better spent elsewhere.

1. Start a list for tasks you can outsource.
1. Ask yourself these questions:
  - What do I not like doing?
  - What am I not good at doing (and don't care to get better at)?
  - What have I been putting off for a while?
  - What 20% of things cost me 80% of my time?
  - What 20% of things create 80% of my stress/anger/unhappiness?
  - What could a freelancer do for less than the value of my time?
1. Log everything you do for a few days. Review the above questions on this log.
1. Look over your list and think about crossing out any task which:
  - Doesn't actually need to be done (Don't do these yourself)
  - Doesn't have a better use of my time
  - Is vitally important (and you'd rather do it personally)
  - You can do better or good enough for the project
  - Would be too expensive to outsource
  - Would cause you undue stress/cost if it was not completed well or on time by a freelancer
