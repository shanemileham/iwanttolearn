{% include toc %}

## Goals
- Optimal mental and athletic performance
- Ability to lucid dream
- Minimal sleep while attaining the above

## Axioms
- Sleep is typically characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity
-


## Statements To Organize
- Experimental data of sleep waves (deeper sleep at beginning of night) --> [basic rest-activity cycle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_rest-activity_cycle)
- "Morning" and "Evening" people are determined by questions like "What time would you get up if you were entirely free to plan your day?" ([reference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningness%E2%80%93eveningness_questionnaire)). There is some genetic influence on these preferences. However, people perform the same on cognitive tests regardless of their morning/evening preference and time of the day. [Chronotype](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype). Humans can have a propensity to be morning people or evening people; these behavioral preferences are called chronotypes for which there are various assessment questionnaires and biological marker correlations.




## Statements to Verify

## Things I've Verified Experimentally
- Different behaviors/workouts require different amount of sleep
- it’s more important to wake up at the same time than fall asleep at the same time
- Easier to fly E-->W, Circadian rhythm is over 24 hours

## Questions
- What is the best sleep schedule?
- How do you get good quality sleep?
- Is sleep reduction really okay? Does it hinder optimal physical performance?
- Under what conditions is taking a red-eye flight okay?
- How do you best entrain your circadian rhythm?

## Outline
- What is sleep
- Effects
- Optimizations
- Polyphasic, etc.
- Dreaming
