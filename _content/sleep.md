## Goals
- Optimal mental and athletic performance
- Ability to lucid dream
- Minimal sleep while attaining the above

## Things I've Verified Experimentally

- it’s more important to wake up at the same time than fall asleep at the same time
- Easier to fly E-->W, Circadian rhythm is over 24 hours

## Questions

- Under what conditions is taking a red-eye flight okay?

## Outline
