Split up money in multiple wallets
Do big transactions split
“If your PC is reasonably safe myetherwallet is the best option. If you are not sure it is best pratice to use a bootable Linux USB stick. If you are really handling a huge amount of crypto I recommend getting either a "ledger wallet" or a "trezor". I just got a ledger wallet and now I can finally chill, knowing my crypto is safe. :)”


Pieces of history
 In this game plan, S2X proponents announce the impending fork, which predictably causes (a) the BTC price to rise as speculators hoard BTC to benefit from the ‘free’ B2X coins post-fork, and (b) also causes the secondary alt-coin market to fall as alts are traded for BTC. At a pre-determined point, the manipulators use their now-appreciated BTC to buy back the undervalued-alts. Once this this done, they announce the suspension of the hard fork, and the alts predictably bounce hard, at which point they sell for an easy 30-50% gain.

So to summarize, I recommend bittrex (for crypto trading only) and bitstamp (for getting fiat on/off) for the time being
Coinbase is trash, I am stuck with a $250 weekly limit smh. I personally use bittrex, but there’s also bitstamp… Sorry not bittrex, CEX & Bitstamp is what I meant (andrei)
Marcel [03:54] Also don't use bitfinex ^^
