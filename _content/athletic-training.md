## Part 0 - Axioms

### Axioms
Specificity of adaptation
Weakest link theory (+ each sport stresses links differently, so want to profile accordingly)

_Each successive level will investigate one link in the chain and ways to optimize_

## Part 1 - How to Stress the Body

### Biomechanics
Biomechanics --> train with the right form

### Neuromuscular System
How to train biomechanics effectively
Stretching

### Bioenergetics
Bioenergetics --> train specific to metabolic pathways (affects sets/reps)


## Part 2 - How to Recover

### Endocrine System
Now that we have the building blocks for what to stress, this is how you recover


## Specific Training Types



## Exercises
