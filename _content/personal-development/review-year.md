## Review Previous Year
- Goals (use of effort)
  - Did I complete these? Why or why not?
  - By the end of the year, were these what I actually cared about?
- Calendar (use of time)
  - Without looking at your calendar, what was most memorable from last year?
  - What kinds of things were most memorable? Work? Social events? Time with certain people? Feelings?
  - Now looking at your calendar, go through and catalog the events that were most memorable or valuable to you
  - What did I spend a lot of effort on that I don't care about?
  - Now generalize: what uses of time were most valuable, and what were least?
- General Questions
  - What were you most grateful for?
  - What was a painful lesson you learned?
  - What were you most proud of having accomplished?


## Finding Clarity and Direction

- [Octalysis](http://yukaichou.com/lifestyle-gamification/gamify-life-year-challenge/)
- [Tony Robbins - The Power of Momentum](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/pdfs/Momentum2006.pdf)
- [8760 Hours](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/)

For each of the above tools, note where you were in the previous year, where you want to be, and how you will get there. Questions to help you determine how to get there include:
- Do I have the right systems in place to achieve my goals? If not, what systems do I need to introduce?
- Are there potential sticking points you can foresee? If so, how will you avoid those?
