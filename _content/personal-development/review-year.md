{% include toc %}

## Review Previous Year
- Goals (use of effort)
  - Did I complete these? Why or why not?
  - By the end of the year, were these what I actually cared about?
- Calendar (use of time)
  - Without looking at your calendar, what was most memorable from last year?
  - What kinds of things were most memorable? Work? Social events? Time with certain people? Feelings?
  - Now looking at your calendar, go through and catalog the events that were most memorable or valuable to you
  - What did I spend a lot of effort on that I don't care about?
  - Now generalize: what uses of time were most valuable, and what were least?
