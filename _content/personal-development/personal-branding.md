## Steps to create a personal brand
_This is a compiled list of steps to create a personal brand. Other guides explain in more depth but don't cover as many steps, so follow these steps and check out the resources at the end of this page for examples and brainstorming exercises._

### Philosophy
_What is a brand? "A brand is anything—a symbol, design, name, sound, reputation, emotion, employees, tone, and much more—that separates one thing from another." (QuickSprout)_

### Intention
_Decide on your brand_

  - Why do you want to build a personal brand?
  - What personal brands do you love? Why?

  - Passion: What topics or tasks bring you pleasure?
- **Traits/Values/Beliefs**
  - What authentic values do you want to communicate and uphold on your mission?
  - What beliefs do you have that are crucial to your brand or mission?
  - What beliefs/values do you want to avoid? Who/what makes you angry/sad?
- **Expressions/Passions**
  - What are habits or actions that come from your chosen values?
  - What's the story you want to tell? What beliefs do you want to prove right? Who is the protagonist? What's the lesson?

### Direction
_Decide on what direction you want to take your brand_
- **Mission**
  - What problem do you want to solve?

  - Credibility: What's your track record? Why should people trust you can deliver?


### Market
_Decide how your brand will be a business_
- **Audience**
  - Describe a die-hard fan. Why does he/she care about what you have to say? Age? Interests? Gender? Occupation? Education? Anything else that makes them unique?
  - What type of relationship would you like to have with your audience?
- **Competitors**
  - Who else has a similar mission?
  - How are they executing on their personal brand?
  - What do you like about their approach? What would you change?
- **Differentiation**
  - What are your hidden passions and interests that you don’t openly talk about in a professional setting?
  - What makes you different than the other people with a similar mission?
- **Qualities/Benefits**
  - Write an elevator pitch for yourself. Make sure to include (either explicitly or implicitly) your mission, goal, and values. Bonus points if you tell part of a story.
