## Excerpts
### 1. The World of Lucid Dreaming
#### Life is Short
- "Is sleeping through your dreams the best use of your limited lifespan? Not only are you wasting part of your finite store of time to be alive, but you are missing adventures and lessons that could enrich the rest of your life."
- "“Dreams are a reservoir of knowledge and experience,” writes Tibetan Buddhist Tarthang Tulku, “yet they are often overlooked as a vehicle for exploring reality”"
- "We can carry not only knowledge but also moods from the lucid dream state to the waking state."

#### The Experience of Lucid Dreaming
- _Exercise: Your Present State of Consciousness_

#### Lucid Dreaming and Waking Life
- "Because the objects of waking perception actually exist independently of your mind, they remain relatively stable. For example, you can look at this sentence, shut the book for a moment, and reopen to the same page, and you will see the same sentence. But, as you will see in Chapter 3, the same is not true for dreaming."
- "“Impossible” things could happen, and the dream scene itself, rather than disappearing once you know it to be “unreal,” might increase in clarity and brilliance until you found yourself dumbfounded with wonder."

### 2. Preparation for Learning Lucid Dreaming
#### Learning How to Learn
- "Many people experience lucid dreams after reading or hearing about lucid dreaming for the first time. This may be akin to beginner’s luck"
- "Your lucid dream training will start with keeping a dream journal and improving your dream recall. Your preparation for Learning Lucid Dreaming journal will help you discover what your dreams are like. The next step will be to use your collection of dreams to find peculiarities (dreamsigns) that appear often enough in your dreams to be reliable signposts of the dream state. Your list of dreamsigns will help you succeed with the lucid dream induction techniques presented in Chapters 3 and 4."

#### Sleeping Brain, Dreaming Mind
- "Your brain accomplishes its world-modeling task so well that you ordinarily aren’t aware that it is modeling anything. You look with your eyes, and you see. The experience of visual perception seems as straightforward as looking out a window and simply seeing what is there. Nonetheless, seeing, hearing, feeling, or perceiving through any other sense is a process of mental modeling, a simulation of reality. The contents of your consciousness, that is, your current experiences, are constructed and depend on your present purposes, what you are doing and what relevant information is currently available."

#### The mind in sleep
- "While awake and active, the model accurately reflects your relationship to the external world."
- "In the case of sleep, so little sensory input is available from the outside world that you stop maintaining a conscious model of it. When your sleeping brain is activated enough to construct a world model in your consciousness, the model is mostly independent from what is happening in your environment – in other words, a dream."
- "During the active sleep phase, commonly called rapid eye movement or REM sleep, your eyes move rapidly about (under closed lids, of course), much as they would if you were awake. Your breathing becomes quick and irregular, your brain burns as much fuel as it does when you’re awake, and you dream vividly."

#### The sleeper's night journey
- "Approximately seventy to ninety minutes after sleep onset, you enter REM sleep for the first time of the night. After five or ten minutes of REM, and possibly following a brief awakening in which you would likely remember a dream, you sink back into Stage 2 and possibly delta, coming up again for another REM period approximately every ninety minutes, and so on through the night."
- "While learning and practicing lucid dreaming, you should keep in mind two elaborations on this cycle: (1) the length of the REM periods increase as the night proceeds and (2) the intervals between REM periods decrease with time of night, from ninety minutes at the beginning of the night to perhaps only twenty to thirty minutes eight hours later."

#### Communiqué from the dream world
- "I could look in any direction I wished while in a lucid dream, so it occurred to me that I ought to be able to signal while I was having a lucid dream by moving my eyes in a pre-arranged, recognizable pattern."
- "During the night I had a lucid dream in which I moved my eyes left-right-left- right. The next morning, when we looked through the polygraph record, we found the eye movement signals in the middle of a REM period. At this writing, dozens of other lucid dreamers have also successfully signaled from lucid dreams, and these dreams have occurred almost exclusively during REM sleep."

#### Why dreams seem real
- "In all cases, we found time estimates made in lucid dreams were within a few seconds of estimates made in the waking state and likewise quite close to the actual time between signals. From this we have concluded that in lucid dreams, estimated dream time is very nearly equal to clock time; that is, it takes just as long to do something in a dream as it does to actually do it."
- "The method of having lucid dreamers signal from the dream world by means of eye movements has demonstrated a strong relationship between the gazes of dreamers in the dream and their actual eye movements under closed lids."
- "One of the most dramatic demonstrations of the correspondence between physiology and dream activity came from studies of lucid dream sex.... her vaginal muscle activity, vaginal pulse amplitude, and respiration rate reached their highest values of the night, and they also were considerably elevated in comparison to the rest of the REM period. Contrary to expectation, heart rate increased only slightly. Since then, we have carried out similar experiments with two male lucid dreamers. In both cases, respiration showed striking increases in rate. Again, there were no significant elevations of the heart rate. Interestingly, although both oneironauts reported vividly realistic orgasms in their lucid dreams, neither actually ejaculated, in contrast to the “wet dreams” commonly experienced by adolescent males, which frequently are not associated with erotic dreams."
- "The experiments just reviewed supported the conclusion that the events you experience while asleep and dreaming produce effects on your brain (and, to a lesser extent, your body) much the same as if you were to experience the corresponding events while awake. Additional studies uphold this conclusion. When lucid dreamers hold their breaths or breathe fast in a dream, they really do hold their breaths or pant. Furthermore, the differences in brain activity caused by singing versus counting in the waking state (singing tends to engage the right hemisphere and counting, the left) are nearly duplicated in the lucid dream. In short, to our brains, dreaming of doing something is equivalent to actually doing it."

#### Social Values and Lucid Dreaming
- "Our culture offers little social support to those interested in exploring mental states. This resistance probably has its roots in the behaviorist perspective in psychology, which treated all animals, including humans, as “black boxes” whose actions were entirely dependent on external inputs."

#### Concerns About Lucid Dreaming: Questions and Answers
- "The overwhelming majority of lucid dreams are positive, rewarding experiences, much more so than ordinary dreams (to say nothing of nightmares). Nevertheless, there probably will be some people who find the experience of lucid dreaming frightening and, in some cases, extremely disturbing. For this reason we cannot recommend lucid dreaming to everyone. On the other hand, we are confident that for people no more than “normally neurotic,” lucid dreaming is completely harmless."
- "Lucid dreams occur only rarely unless you go to sleep with the deliberate and definite intention to become conscious, or lucid, in your dreams. Thus, I understood that I would be able to regulate (and limit, if necessary) the frequency of my lucid dreams."
- "dreams are not letters from the unconscious mind, but experiences created through the interactions of the unconscious and conscious mind. In dreams, more unconscious knowledge is available to our conscious experience."
- "I don’t think that you should always be conscious that you are dreaming any more than I think that you should always be conscious of what you are doing in waking life. Sometimes self-consciousness can interfere with effective performance"
- "Dreaming lucidly is usually just as restful as dreaming nonlucidly. Since lucid dreams tend to be positive experiences, you may actually feel invigorated after them."

#### Getting to Know Your Dreams
##### How to recall your dreams
- "Learning to remember your dreams is necessary if you want to learn how to dream lucidly."
- "First, without recall, even if you do have a lucid dream, you won’t remember it."
- "Second, good dream recall is crucial because to become lucid you have to recognize that your dream is a dream, while it is happening. Since they are your dreams that you are trying to recognize, you have to become familiar with what they are like."
- "you need to get to know what your dreams are like, and in particular, what is dreamlike about them. You can accomplish this by collecting your dreams and analyzing them for dreamlike elements."
- "Before it will be worth your time to work on lucid dream induction methods, you should be able to recall at least one dream every night."
- "The first step to good dream recall is getting plenty of sleep."
- "The first dream of the night is the shortest, perhaps only ten minutes in length, while after eight hours of sleep, dream periods can be forty-five minutes to an hour long."
- "dreams are not recalled unless the sleeper awakens directly from the dream, rather than after going on to other stages of sleep."
- "If you find that you sleep too deeply to awaken from your dreams, try setting an alarm clock to awaken you at a time when you are likely to be dreaming. Since REM periods occur at approximately ninety-minute intervals, good times will be multiples of ninety minutes from your bedtime. Aim for the later REM periods by setting the alarm to go off at four and a half, six, or seven and a half hours after you go to sleep."
- "You should get into the habit of asking yourself this question the moment you awaken: “What was I dreaming?” Do this first or you’ll forget some or all of your dream, due to interference from other thoughts. Don’t move from the position in which you awaken.... Also, don’t think of the day’s concerns.... If you remember nothing, keep trying for several minutes, without moving or thinking of anything else. Usually, pieces and fragments of the dream will come to you.... ask yourself: “What was I just thinking?” and “How was I just feeling?”"
- "When you recall a scene, ask yourself what happened before that, and before that"

##### Keeping a dream journal
- "Get a notebook or diary for writing down your dreams. The notebook should be attractive to you and exclusively dedicated for the purpose of recording dreams."
- "Your dream journal is a tool, and you are the only person who is going to read it. Describe the way images and characters look and sound and smell, and don’t forget to describe the way you felt in the dream – emotional reactions are important clues in the dream world. Record anything unusual, the kinds of things that would never occur in waking life"
- "Put the date at the top of the page. Record your dream under the date, carrying over for as many pages as required. Leave a blank page following each dream description for exercises you will do later."
- "title your journal entry with a short, catchy title that captures the subject or mood of the dream. “The Guardian of the Spring” or “Riot in the Classroom” are examples of good descriptive titles."

##### Dreamsigns: Doors to Lucidity
- "People don’t become lucid more often in the presence of dreamsigns because of a normal tendency to rationalize and confabulate – they make up stories to explain what is going on, or they think, “There must be some explanation.”"
- "Each of us has his or her own individual dreamsigns"
- "There are four primary categories [of dreamsigns]. The first one, inner awareness, refers to things that dreamers (egos) perceive as happening within themselves, such as thoughts and feelings. The other three categories (action, form, and context) classify elements of the dream environment. The action category includes the activities and motions of everything in the dream world – the dream ego, other characters, and objects. Form refers to the shapes of things, people, and places, which are often bizarre and frequently transform in dreams. The final category is context. Sometimes in dreams the combination of elements – people, places, actions, or things, is odd, although there is nothing inherently strange about any item by itself."

#### The Dreamsign Inventory
##### Inner Awareness
- "You have a peculiar thought, a strong emotion, feel an unusual sensation, or have altered perceptions. The thought can be one that is unusual, that could occur only in a dream, or that “magically” affects the dream world. The emotion can be inappropriate or oddly overwhelming. Sensations can include the feeling of paralysis, or of leaving your body, as well as unusual physical feelings and unexpectedly sudden or intense sexual arousal. Perceptions may be unusually clear or fuzzy, or you may be able to see or hear something you wouldn’t be able to in waking life."
- **Thoughts** (e.g. “I’m trying to figure out where the house and furnishings are from, and I realize this is an odd thing to be thinking about.”)
- **Emotions** (e.g. “I am filled with extreme anxiety and remorse.”)
- **Sensations** (e.g. “It feels like there’s a giant hand squeezing my head.”)
- **Perceptions** (e.g. “I somehow can hear two men talking even though they are far away.”)

##### Action
- "You, another dream character, or a dream thing (including inanimate objects and animals) do something unusual or impossible in waking life. The action must occur in the dream environment, that is, not be a thought or feeling in the dreamer’s mind. Malfunctioning devices are examples of object action dreamsigns."
- **Ego action** (e.g. “I’m riding home on a unicycle.”)
- **Character action** (e.g. “The hairdresser refers to a blueprint to cut my hair.”)
- **Object action** (e.g. “The car accelerates dangerously, and the brakes don’t work.”)

##### Form
- "Your shape, the shape of a dream character, or that of a dream object is oddly formed, deformed, or transforms. Unusual clothing and hair count as anomalies of form. Also, the place you are in (the setting) in the dream may be different than it would be in waking life."
- **Ego form** (e.g. “I am Mozart.”)
- **Character form** (e.g. “Her face changes as I look at her.”)
- **Setting form** (e.g. “The drafting room was the wrong shape.”)
- **Object form** (e.g. “I see a tiny purple kitten.”)

##### Context
- "The place or situation in the dream is strange. You may be somewhere that you are unlikely to be in waking life, or involved in a strange social situation. Also, you or another dream character could be playing an unaccustomed role. Objects or characters may be out of place, or the dream could occur in the past or future."
- **Ego role** (e.g. “It was a James Bond type of dream, with me in the starring role.”)
- **Character role** (e.g. “My friend is assigned to be my husband.”)
- **Character place** (e.g. “My coworkers and former high school friends are together.”)
- **Object place** (e.g. “My bed was in the street.”)
- **Setting place** (e.g. “I’m in an amusement park.”)
- **Setting time** (e.g. “I am in grade school.”)
- **Situation** (e.g. “A commercial is being filmed at my house.”)

## Exercises
### 1. The World of Lucid Dreaming
#### Your Present State of Consciousness

1. **Look** - Become aware of what you see: notice the richly varied and vivid impressions –shapes, colors, movement, dimensionality, the entire visible world.
2. **Listen** - Become aware of what you hear: register the various sounds taken in by your ears – a diverse range of intensities, pitches, and tonal qualities, perhaps including the commonplace miracle of speech or the wonder of music.
3. **Feel** - Become aware of what you touch: texture (smooth, rough, dry, sticky, or wet), weight (heavy, light, solid, or empty), pleasure, pain, heat and cold, and the rest. Also note how your body feels right now and compare that to the many other ways it feels at other times, tired or energetic, stiff or limber, painful or pleasant, and so on.
4. **Taste** - Become aware of what it is like to taste: taste a number of different foods and substances, or remember and vividly imagine their tastes.
5. **Smell** - Become aware of what you smell: the odor of warm bodies, earth, incense, smoke, perfume, coffee, onions, alcohol, and the sea. Remember and imagine as many of them as you can.
6. **Breathing** - Attend to your breathing. A moment ago you probably were not consciously aware of your breathing even though you have inhaled and exhaled fifty times while doing this exercise. Hold your breath for a few seconds. Let it out. Now take a deep breath. Notice that being conscious of your breathing allows you to alter it deliberately.
7. **Emotions** - Become aware of your feelings. Remember the difference between anger and joy, serenity and excitement, and as many other emotions as you care to feel. How real do emotions feel?
8. **Thoughts** - Become aware of your thoughts. What have you been thinking while doing this exercise? What are you thinking right now? How real do thoughts seem?
9. **“I”** - Become aware of the fact that your world always includes you. As William James noted, it is I see, I hear, I feel, I think that is the basic fact of experience.5 You are not what you see, hear, think, or feel; you have these experiences. Perhaps most essentially, you are who is aware. You are always at the center of your multidimensional universe of experience, but you are not always consciously aware of yourself. Briefly repeat the exercise with the following difference: At the same time you attend to each of the various aspects of your experience, be aware that it is you who is noticing these things (“I see the light...”).
10. **Awareness of awareness** - Finally, become aware of your awareness. Normally, awareness focuses on objects outside ourselves, but it can itself be an object of awareness. In the light of ordinary experience, we seem to be distinct and limited centers of awareness, each alone in our inner worlds. In the light of eternity, mystics tell us, we are ultimately all one – the unlimited awareness that is the source of being. Here, experience cannot be adequately expressed by language.

### 2. Preparation for Learning Lucid Dreaming
#### Cataloging your dreamsigns
1. **Keep a dream journal** - Record your dreams. Proceed to the next step after collecting a dozen dreams.
2. **Catalog your dreamsigns** - While continuing to collect dreams, mark the dreamsigns.
3. **Classify each dreamsign using the dreamsign inventory** - Next to each dreamsign on your list, write the name of its category from the dreamsign inventory.
4. **Pick target dreamsign categories** - Count how many times each dreamsign category (inner awareness, action, form, or context) occurs and rank them by frequency. Whichever occurs most often will be your target dreamsign category in the next step. If there is a tie between categories, pick the one that appeals to you.
5. **Practice looking for dreamsigns while you are awake** - Make a habit of examining your daily life for events that fit under your dreamsign category. For instance, if your target category is action, study how you, other people, animals, objects, and machines act and move. Become thoroughly familiar with the way things usually are in waking life. This will prepare you to notice when something unusual happens in a dream.

#### Goal setting for success
1. **Set explicit, specific, and numerical goals** - e.g. remember x dreams per night
2. **Set difficult but realistic goals** - e.g. x dreams, learn how to fly
3. **Set short-range as well as long-range goals** - e.g. perform a number of tests each day, x lucid dreams per month, learn how to fly by x
4. **Record and evaluate your progress** - Do it.
