## Chapter 1 - Structure and Function of Body Systems

![Appendicular vs Axial Skeleton](http://www.teachpe.com/images/anatomy-physiology/axiel-skeleton400.jpg)

Skeleton
- Heavy loads/impact --> bone density ++, mineral content ++
- Adaptation period of bone is longer than skeletal muscle
- Vary stimulus frequency, intensity, type

![Types of Joints](http://slideplayer.com/9732189/31/images/3/Types+of+Joints+Fibrous+joint+Cartilaginous+joint+Synovial+joint.jpg)
- Fibrous joints allow virtually no movement
- Cartilaginous joints allow limited movement
- Synovial joints allow considerable movement

![Structure of Skeletal Muscle](http://library.open.oregonstate.edu/aandp/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/01/1001_Muscle_Tissue_revised-1024x516.png)
- Epimysium = fibrous connective tissue contiguous with tendons
- Tendon is attached to bone periosteum
- Bone periosteum = connective tissue covering all bones
- Muscle cells (fibers) = long cylindricals cells 50-100um in diameter, containing many nuclei
- Fasciculi = muscle fiber bundles consisting of up to 150 fibers

![Neiromuscular Junction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DxShix3Mqow/hqdefault.jpg)
- Each muscle cell has only one neuromuscular junction (although a single motor neuron innervates many muscle fibers)

![Motor Unit](http://images.tutorvista.com/content/nervous-coordination/neuron-structure.jpeg)
- Motor Unit = a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates
